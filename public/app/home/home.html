        Scylla is a tool designed to help you monitor and track changes to URLs.
        There are two ways we help you manage change:
        <div class="row-fluid">
            <div class="span6">
                <h3>Single URL Reports</h3>
                <p> <i class="livicon" data-n="notebook" data-s="18" data-c="#666" data-hc="#000"></i>
                    With Single URL <strong>Report</strong>s, we take a screenshot of a specific URL and allow you to
                    compare the current state with a known <strong>master</strong> (i.e. what you expect it to look like).
                </p>
                <p> <i class="livicon" data-n="sitemap" data-s="18" data-c="#666" data-hc="#000"></i>
                    These reports can be collected into a <strong>Batch</strong> of reports, which can be launched by
                    clicking on the Rocket. You may also choose to schedule a batch to run at a specific time. After a
                    batch is run on a schedule, it will email the <strong>watchers</strong> with a short summary of the
                    results, a great way to be greeted every morning when you come in to work.
                </p>

            <div class="span6">
                <h3>AB Comparisons</h3>
                <p> <i class="livicon" data-n="balance" data-s="18" data-c="#666" data-hc="#000"></i>
                    With <strong>AB Compare</strong>, we take a screenshot of two separate URLs and compare them to each
                    other. This tends to be a great tool to use while in active development or refactoring.

        <h2>Visual Differences</h2>
        Our Visual Diff tool is available to inspect differences, regardless of which path you choose. The tool has two
        modes to help you identify and analyze differences:
        <div class="row-fluid">
            <div class="span6">
                <h3>Swipe</h3>
                <p>
                    In this mode, the slider bar will let you swipe between the <strong>Master / Current</strong> or
                    <strong>Url A / Url B</strong>.  By sliding, you will be able to see a seam where the image changes,
                    helping you identify exactly what the differences are. You'll be able to count the pixels an element
                    moved, or see two colors side-by-side.<br/>
                    <video src="\images\swipe.m4v" autoplay loop controls>
                        Your browser does not support the <code>video</code> element.
                    </video>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="span6">
                <h3>Diff Overlay</h3>
                <p>
                    In this mode, the slider bar will adjust the visibility of a map of changed pixels.  This map shows
                    each and every pixel that changed in bright red, with the rest of the image muted. By reducing the
                    transparency, you will be able to see the original image more strongly.<br/>
