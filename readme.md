A tool for snatching snapshots of urls... specifically, reports.







Name & Icon
-----------
Scylla is a part of Greek Mythology, originally a beautiful daughter of a God, but turned into a sea monster.

She has 12 tentacles and is known to sit high up on a cliff and wait for sailors to sail close enough so that she
can snatch them up or throw boulders down on top of them.
