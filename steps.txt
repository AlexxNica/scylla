going to try packaging all the shit thats needed into a directory and then run fpm

* moved all necessary files to to_deb/
* fpm -s dir -t deb -n "look-im-scylla" -v 0.42 to_deb/
* dpkg -x look-im-scylla_0.42_amd64.deb .


necessary files/folders:

Gruntfile.js
LICENSE-APACHE.md
LICENSE-MIT.md
LICENSE.md
api
config
images
node_modules
package.json
public
readme.md
repl.js
server.js
test

started with `node server.js`, and defaults to port 3000

todo:
-how should scylla look after it's been deployed
    -move necesarry folders into a to_deb arranged in whatever way
    -build deb
    -after deb is deployed, what post install stuff should be run  
        -dependencies?? node/npm fosho, all node modules are included so yolo
-how to configure chef stuff
-make sure vagrant has fpm


future magic todos:
-run tests?
-some finageling so scylla can run on a given port???

questions:
- I don't need all the files/folders in the given project to be in the deb, how to I whitelist the files/folders I want?
-

how todo: 
-make a to_deb/
    should look like
    bin/
        scylla
    etc/
        init/
            scylla.conf
    opt/
        sm/
            scylla/
                *all necessary scylla files


====================

IT'S CHEF TIME!!

notes:
- chef will spin up a sql instance with a root account and a user account
- there will only ever be one user account :: one scylla instance (at least for now)
- MAIN SHIT need to grab that user/pass from the 'data bag' and shove it into scylla/config/storage.js (see vagrant/bootstrap.sh:111)
    -> do this using a template/.erb?
