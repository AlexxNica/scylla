OLD INTRO
-----------------------------------------
Scylla detects visual changes in web pages by capturing screenshots of webpages, comparing them and then alerting the user to the specific changes. It displays the visual changes in an easy-to-explore manner, which makes it accessible to all levels of technical ability. Scylla can serve as the first line of testing. Run immediately after a change, Scylla will allow you to immediately ensure that things changed as planned. Run after a refactor, it will allow you to be certain things remained the same. The built-in scheduling lets you capture screens first thing in the morning, and a summary email will let QA know if parts of the site require their attention.
